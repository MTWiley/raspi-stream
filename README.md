    # Written/Put together by MTWiley
    # This project is intended to setup a raspberry pi & camera module for streaming.
    # This was explicity written/documented for the purpose of being used with Neptune Systems Apex Fusion.
    # But it can be adapted for use with just about anything.
    # See https://github.com/MTWiley/raspi-stream/wiki for more information on how to set this up.
